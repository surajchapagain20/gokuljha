				<p>This is <strong>Detail </strong>, and fully fledged concepts of hardware and networking issues faced on day to day basis.</p>
				<p>Computer and Laptop Problems and Solutions</p>
 <font color="black"><strong><font size="4"><b>1.How to start a desktop Computer?(starting a computer)</font></strong></font></b></br> 
a.	Connect power source from your power adaptor to your CPU.</br>
b.	Connect power source from your power adaptor to your Monitor.</br>
c.	Connect interface cable from your PC into your CPU (VGA)</br>
d.	Connect your network cable(CAT6) in to your CPU</br>
e.	Connect Mouse, Keyboard in to your CPU</br>
f.	Switch ON the Power supply.</br>
g.	Press the start button of your CPU</br>
h.	Computer will now load the system operating files already installed in it.</br>

 <font color="black"><strong><font size="4"><b>2. What if Your Monitor display nothing?(No display problem in monitor)</font></strong></font></b> </p>
If your monitor display nothing even after proper turn on, there could be many possible reasons. </br>
a.	Your monitor driver is either not installed or installed incorrectly. (Since today’s computer all come with plug and play features, this issue is less possible).</br>
b.	Check the interface cable in between your CPU and monitor for loose connection.</br>
c.	Check your hardware components of your CPU i.e. RAM, PSU (power supply unit) and all the cabling across the mother board. Reseat the component like RAM in its slot. (Avoid this step if you find it difficult.)(Consult IT Dept.)</br>
d.	If still after reseating your hardware components the problem exists, be sure the BIOS configuration is done improperly. Reinstalling the OS in to your computer may be required. Consult IT personnel.</br>

<font color="black"><strong><font size="4"><b>3.	Why your computer Hang OR Freezes??? Possible solutions (how to open task Manager?)</font></b></strong></font></br> 
a.	Sometimes your computer will freeze or hang for a short while as it carried out a lot of processes, so initially wait… and don’t be tempted to press more buttons or do not click on the screen, as this can give more tasks for the computer to do and enhance the problem.</br>
b.	If it hangs for longer, then press ALT, CTRL, & DEL button TOGETHER. And select Start Task Manager. A screen will appear with all the programs lists that are currently running into your computer. Now on the status column of the application you can see some program showing “not responding”…..End task those programs….a next message screen will come showing end now or end the program….click in it…..refresh a couple of time …….(pressing F5 button on keyboard).</br>
  <IMG SRC="images\TaskManager.jpg" ALT="some text" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=500></br>
   <IMG SRC="images\EndNow.jpg" ALT="some text" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=200></br>
c.	If still the problem is not solved uninstall the recently installed program or driver that is causing your desktop to hang.</br>

d.	Your computer may also freeze because it is running out of space on the hard drive. Be sure your space indication in your C drive (OS installed drive) is not marked as RED. Delete files from the drive, if it is marked RED. </br>
 <IMG SRC="images\drive.jpg" ALT="some text" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=500></br>
e.	Clean your disk by right click on your C drive, select properties and then clicking the option Disk Clean up. This will remove all the unnecessary files that are causing your computer to freeze.</br>
<IMG SRC="images\diskCleanUp.jpg" ALT="some text" WIDTH=700 HEIGHT=500></br>
f.	Delete the temp files. Press win+R button in your keyboard and type %temp% in run window, and then press enter. Select all files and delete it.</br>

<font color="black"><strong><font size="4"><b>16.	Is your computer heating? What should I do?</font></b></strong></font></br> 
Heat is a computer’s enemy. Computers are designed with heat dispersion and ventilation in mind so they don’t overheat. If too much heat builds up, your computer may become unstable or suddenly shut down. Normally your computer’s CPU or GPU (Graphics card) are responsible for heating your computer and there are several reasons for your system getting heated most often. Your cooling system malfunctioning can heat your computer and can damage many components as well.
If you’re encountering system instability issues like abrupt shut downs, blue screens, and freezes, your computer may be overheating.
Some of the way to avoid heating of your computer
a.	Accumulation of dust can cause your fan working improper with nuisance noise and eventually heating your system. Clean your CPU chassis and components with either a vacuum or blowing air from your hand fan.
b.	Ensure proper ventilation for your computer and Laptop so that the generated heat can easily be get rid of.
c.	Check whether your fan is working or not. Open the case of your CPU and then start your computer, watch whether your fan is operating correctly or not. If not replace the fan.
d.	In case of your laptop which is a bit difficult to do maintenance itself, what you do is at the back of the laptop there is the cover for the fan. Unscrew those screw and check for the mobility of the fan. Blow air to remove the dust and check with starting up your laptop.
e.	Do not keep your dead battery inside your laptop. Either replace it with a new one or keep your battery slot empty and operate your Laptop on A.C supply only.

<font color="black"><strong><font size="4"><b>	18.What is a 32-bit and 64-bit operating system and which should I choose?</font></b></strong></font></br> 
The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's processor (also called a CPU), handles information. The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system.
To install a 64-bit version of Windows 7, you need a CPU that's capable of running a 64-bit version of Windows. The benefits of using a 64-bit operating system are most apparent when you have a large amount of random access memory (RAM) installed on your computer, typically 4 GB of RAM or more. In such cases, because a 64-bit operating system can handle large amounts of memory more efficiently than a 32-bit operating system, a 64-bit system can be more responsive when running several programs at the same time and switching between them frequently.

<font color="black"><strong><font size="4"><b>	19.How should I know that my current computer can support 64-bit window?</font></b></strong></font></br> 
To run a 64-bit version of Windows, your computer must have a 64-bit-capable processor. To find out if your processor is 64-bit-capable in Windows 7 or Windows Vista, do the following:
a.	Open Performance Information and Tools by clicking the Start button , and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type Performance Information and Tools, and then, in the list of results, click Performance Information and Tools.
b.	Do one of the following:
•	In Windows 7, click View and print detailed performance and system information.
•	In Windows Vista, click View and print details.
c.	In the System section, you can see what type of operating system you're currently running under System type, and whether or not you can run a 64-bit version of Windows under 64-bit capable. (If your computer is already running a 64-bit version of Windows, you won't see the 64-bit capable listing.)
